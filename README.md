Welcome to ClubHub, a helpful tool for helping student and clubs around the University of Florida better connect. Our mission is to unite students, faculty, and club organizers through a site that facilitates communication.

Some of the most important features on our site are the Question Forums page and Find Clubs page. Further details are explained on our site, but in Forums Page allows users to make posts about any topic for others to see. The Find Clubs page allows users to find other clubs that they may want to join. The My Account page allows users to see non-sensitive account information. It also creates the opportunity for them to associate themselves with clubs. Lastly, the Information Hub is a compilation of important resources for club leaders. This creates a space where anyone can learn about organizing a club and being a leader of an organization.

You can run our site locally by reviewing the "Dependencies" and "InstructionsToRun" ReadMes.
